<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This is an Inventory Management web application. This project started as a proof of concept after learning a bit about building API's in ASP.NET Core, but I later decided I wanted to try adding a frontend to the project using Razor pages. 
There is some logging functionality here as well, but it's still a WIP. 

Planned:
* Finish building out the frontend of the site 
* Add authentication (?) 

### Built With
* ASP.NET Core 
* SQLite
* Serilog
